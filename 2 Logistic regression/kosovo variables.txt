Paper 1
Covariates for logistic regression 
     - Distance from roads (dynamic)
     - Distance from settlements (static, recomputed, for prediction they keep it unchanged.)
     - Distance from forest edge (dynamic, recomputed: buffers expanding outwards from the forest/non-forest boundary. As deforestation happens, the forest edge moves)
     - Fragmentation index (dynamic, recomputed: in a 3×3 window from the pattern of forest vs non-forest. )
     - Slope (static)
     - Elevation (static)



Paper 2
Covariates for logistic regression 
     - distance from river (static)
     - agricultural density (static)
     - Altitude (static)
     - settlement density (static)
     - forest density (static)
     - population density (static)
     - distance from road (static)
     - Slope (static)



Paper 3
Covariates for logistic regression 
     - Slope (static)
     - Elevation (static)
     - Aspect (from DEM, static) = which direction the slope faces (north/west…)
     - Distance from roads (static)
     - Distance from residential areas (static)


Parer 4
Covariates for logistic regression 
     - Precipitation (dynamic)
     - Temperature (dynamic)
     - simple license, (like to use forest) (dynamic)
     - forest concession,  (dynamic, though later dropped due to multicollinearity.)
     - volume of charcoal exploited, (dynamic)
     - agricultural areas, (dynamic)
     - Villages, (dynamic)
     - population dynamics (dynamic)
They use dynamic but non-spatial predictors (time series per district) to explain the temporal behavior of forest cover.

Now I want to build a logistic regression for Kosovo for 2000 - 2024 data Tree cover loss using this website: https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2024-v1.12/download.html

I assume non-linearity between response and predictors:
I assume next predictors to play an influence on tree-cover loss:
Socio-economic factors:
     - Population density (Dynamic)  
     - Population growth (Dynamic)
     - GDP (dynamic)
     - Land-use change (dynamic) Map with main land use types in Kosovo?
     - Water exploitation index
Biophysical factors:

     - Elevation (static)
     - Monthly average precipitation in Kosovo (Dynamic)
     - Monthly average temperatures in Kosovo (Dynamic)

     - Distance from hydrography
     - Distance from localities with <2500 inhabitants
     - Distance from human settlements
